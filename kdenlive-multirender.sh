# kdenlive-multirender.sh | Multi-threaded video rendering for Kdenlive
# Version 0.0.2
# Created by unfa, 2017-12-13, 2018-03-06

### File naming: all tempporary files created by Kdenlive-Multirender are prefixed with 'kmr-'. So after the fact you can clean it up wiht 'rm kmr-*' command (unless you've choosen to name other files in this fashion).

# Getting input

INPUT=$1 # The first passed argument has to be a Kdenlive render script (for example "Project_001.sh")
PARTS=$2 # The second passed argument is the number of parts to split the rendering job into.  High values (like 64) will help mnimize data loss in case of a system crash when rendering a big project. Values smaller than THREADS make no sense.
THREADS=$3 # The third passed argument is the amount of rendering threads to be running at any given time in parallell. Advised values are between 2 and 6. It's recommended to start with a smaller value and see how much memory and CPU time is consumed with a tool like htop. Running too many threads may starve the system for memory and as a result - take it down or progress extremely slowly, which defeats the purpose of this script.
